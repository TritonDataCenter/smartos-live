	dependency info
	This depends on the system/zones svc which seems weird since that
	svc runs late in boot because it depends on milestone/multi-user-server.
	Our svc does the initial setup of the infrastructure zones on the
	headnode so we need the system/zones svc to run first so that we can
	install and boot the infrastructure zones.  The reason this seems
	weird is that this svc also sets up the zpool when we first boot,
	before we reboot to install the infrastructure zones, so it might seem
	like it should run early in boot, but it can't because of the zone
	issue described above.

	The dependency on network/physical is needed since all of the earlier
	svcs which have a dependency on network/physical are using optional_all.
	That makes sense for those svcs since they can come up without a
	network, but for SmartOS, by this point we require the network to be
	there.
