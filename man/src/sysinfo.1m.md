# sysinfo(1M) -- Output information about this SmartOS system.

## SYNOPSIS

    sysinfo [<options>]


## DESCRIPTION

The sysinfo tool allows you to gather several pieces of information about a
SmartOS host in one place.  With no arguments system info is written to stdout
as a JSON object.

As some of the data can take some time to gather and most does not change after
the system is up, the data is cached.  This allows sysinfo to return quickly
after the cache has been created.  Any scripts which modify data that is
included in the sysinfo output should run 'sysinfo -u' to update the cache after
making changes.


## OPTIONS

**-f**
    force an update of cache and then output the updated
    data

**-p**
    output parseable key=value format instead of JSON
    (JSON is the default)

**-u**
    update the cache only, do not output anything

**-?**
    Print help and exit.


## FIELDS

  The fields of the JSON output from sysinfo are listed
  below along with a brief description.  They're also
  marked as one of:

    GZ only         -- only available in sysinfo output from the global zone
    NGZ only        -- only available in sysinfo output from a non-global zone
    GZ and NGZ      -- available in sysinfo output from global or non-global
    GZ SDC only     -- same as GZ only but also only available in Joyent's SDC

  "Live Image"

    This is the build stamp of the current platform.

    GZ and NGZ

  "Manufacturer"

    This is the name of the Hardware Manufacturer as set in the SMBIOS.
    Eg. "Dell".

    GZ only

  "MiB of Memory"

    The amount of DRAM (in MiB) available to processes.  For the GZ this is the
    amount available to the system.  For a non-global zone, this is the cap on
    memory for this zone.

    GZ and NGZ

  "Network Interfaces"

    An object with a member for each physical NIC attached to the machine.
    Entries include the MAC, ip4addr, Link Status and NIC Names (tags) for each
    interface.

    GZ only

  "Product"

    This is the name of the Product as set by your hardware vendor in the SMBIOS
    Eg. "PowerEdge R710".

    GZ only

  "SDC Agents"

    In SDC this is an array of installed agents and their versions.

    GZ SDC only

  "SDC Version"

    The version of SDC this platform belongs to.

    GZ SDC Only

  "Serial Number"

    Manufacturers serial number as set in SMBIOS.

    GZ only

  "Setup"

    Used to indicate whether the machine has been setup and is ready for
    provisioning.

    GZ SDC only

  "System Type"

    This is the output of 'uname -s'.

    attached to.

    GZ and NGZ
