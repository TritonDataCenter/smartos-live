The uefi-csm-rom.bin file is a binary generated from the uefi-edk2 package
shipped in illumos-extra, where the source was from 2014 (the last time CSM
was available).

The uefi-rom.bin is a binary generated from the illumos downstream of
uefi-edk2, specifically the il-edk2-stable202411 branch.

Building the uefi ROM in illumos-extra may be able to happen again, now that
SmartOS builds require a 2024.4 pkgsrc zone. Until we decide about moving
uefi ROM builds into illumos-extra, a 2024.4 build zone can build a ROM from
il-edk2-* branches as long as the following environment variables are set:

GCCVER=13
GCCPATH=/opt/local/gcc13
GMAKE=/opt/local/bin/gmake
GPATCH=/opt/local/bin/gpatch
GAS=/opt/local/bin/gas
GAR=/opt/local/bin/gar
GLD=/opt/local/bin/gld
GOBJCOPY=/opt/local/bin/gobjcopy

If one wants to use the strap-cache gcc14 that can SmartOS, one should
substitute the following AFTER a successful gcc14-primary SmartOS build in
/path/to/smartos-live :

GCCVER=14
GCCPATH=/path/to/smartos-live/proto.strap/usr/gcc/14

Other pkgsrc zones post-2021 (i.e. ones with `gld` present) may with with
different settings of the above variables.
