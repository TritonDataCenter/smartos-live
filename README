Quickstart:

  * run configure
  * gmake world
  * gmake live

The configure script sets everything up for building including:

  * ensuring system has required packages installed (and is running on Solaris!)
  * ensuring SUNWspro is installed in /opt/SUNWspro
  * ensures the projects/illumos exists and updates the illumos.sh there
  * ensures the projects/illumos-extras exists
  * downloads the opensolaris manpages

The "make world" works as follows (using the tools/build_illumos script):

  * The illumos source in projects/illumos (can be a link) is build and
    installed into the proto area pointed to <illumos-live DIR>/proto

  * The illumos-extras are built and installed into the proto area pointed
    to <illumos-live DIR>/proto

  * The local sources in <illumos-live DIR>/src are built and installed
    into <illumos-live DIR>/proto

The "make live" process works as follows (using the tools/build_live script):

  * The manifest is used, directories and links are created and files are taken:
      * first from the <illumos-live DIR>/overlay directory if they exist
        there; or if not
      * next from the <illumos-live DIR>/projects/opensolaris-man directory if
        they exist there; or if not
      * next from the <illumos-live DIR>/overlay directory if they exist there;
        or if not
      * next from the running system rooted at / if they exist there

  * Once the files are copied in, the tools/customize script is run which also
    sources tools/customize.* if they exist

  * Then the image is packed up and put in output with an expanded directory and
    a platform-<BUILDSTAMP>.tgz

  * A log of the live image creation is written to <illumos-live DIR>/build
    directory where entries look like:

      * OK - DIR: indicating a directory that was created
      * OK - LINK: indicating a hard link that was created
      * OK - SYMLINK: indicating a symbolic link that was created
      * OK[A] - FILE: indicating a file that was copied from
        the <illumos-live DIR>/overlay directory
      * OK[P] - FILE: indicating a file that was copied from
        the <illumos-live DIR>/proto directory
      * OK[M] - FILE: indicating a file that was copied from
        the <illumos-live DIR>/projects/opensolaris-man directory
      * OK[S] - FILE: indicating a file that was copied from the running system
      * *FAILED* - indicating a file that was not found in any of the above

Other notes:

  * The resulting image requires a 64-bit machine
  * The BUILDSTAMP is available in the live image in /etc/joyent_buildstamp
  * There is a manifest created:

   output/platform-<BUILDSTAMP>/i86pc/amd64/boot_archive.manifest

   which contains a list of all files/links in the image + md5sums of files and
   is also available in the live image itself in /var/log/manifest
