.SH NAME
sccs-val, val \- validate an SCCS file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBval\fR [\fB-s\fR] [\fB-m\fR \fIname\fR] [\fB-r\fR\fIsid\fR] [\fB-y\fR \fItype\fR] \fIs.filename\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBval\fR utility determines if the specified \fBs.\fRfiles meet the characteristics specified by the indicated arguments. \fBval\fR can process up to 50 files on a single command line.
.sp
.LP
\fBval\fR has a special argument, `\fB\(mi\fR\&', which reads the standard input until the end-of-file condition is detected. Each line read is independently processed as if it were a command line argument list.
.sp
.LP
\fBval\fR generates diagnostic messages on the standard output for each command line and file processed and also returns a single 8\(mibit code upon exit as described below.
.sp
.LP
The 8-bit code returned by \fBval\fR is a disjunction of the possible errors, that is, it can be interpreted as a bit string where (moving from left to right) the bits set are interpreted as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
bit 0 = missing file argument
bit 1 = unknown or duplicate option
bit 2 = corrupted s.file
bit 3 = can not open file or file not in s.file format
bit 4 = the SCCS delta ID (SID) is invalid or ambiguous
bit 5 = the SID does not exist
bit 6 = mismatch between Y% and -y argument
bit 7 = mismatch between sccs-val.1 and -m argument
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\fBval\fR can process two or more files on a given command line, and in turn can process multiple command lines (when reading the standard input). In these cases, an aggregate code is returned which is the logical \fBOR\fR of the codes generated for each command line and file processed.
