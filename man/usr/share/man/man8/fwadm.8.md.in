## DESCRIPTION

The fwadm tool allows you to manage firewall data on a SmartOS system. It
is primarily used to manage firewall rules and remote VMs.

Firewall rules are JSON objects. They contain a rule written in a
Domain-Specific Language, as well as other metadata.  See fwrule(5) and
the "EXAMPLES" section below for rule syntax.

Remote VMs are JSON objects. They represent VMs on other SmartOS hosts.
The format is similar to the vmadm(1M) format with most properties omitted
and some simplified properties. See the "REMOTE VMS", "REMOTE VM PROPERTIES"
and "EXAMPLES" sections below for details.

Firewall rules only apply to VMs that have the firewall\_enabled property set
to true. Rules with an owner\_uuid are scoped to VMs with a matching owner.
Global rules, which are ownerless, will apply to all VMs described in their
targets. Adding, updating or deleting firewall rules or remote VMs will reload
the firewalls of any VMs affected.


## OPTIONS

**-h, --help**
    Print help or subcommand help and exit.

**-v, --verbose**
    Output verbose diagnostic information. When a command results in an
    error, output the stack trace for that error.

**-j, --json**
    Output results or errors as JSON.


## SUBCOMMANDS

    The following commands and options are supported:

    fwadm help [command]

        Print general tool help or help on a specific command.

        Add firewall rules or remote VMs.  A single rule and its properties can
        be added using arguments and options, or the -f option can be used to
        pass a file containing a JSON object with one or many rules and remote
        VMs to be added. See the "EXAMPLES" section below for details on what to
        pass in the JSON object.

## REMOTE VMS

    The purpose of remote VMs is to allow VMs on other SmartOS hosts to be
    included when generating rules.  For example, if the following remote
    VM from another SmartOS host was added:

    {{#indent_and_wrap}}
    {{{rvm_rvm1}}}

    And the following rule:
    {{{rvm_rule1}}}

    {{/indent_and_wrap}}

    The remote VM has the tag role with value bastion, which means that it
    matches the rule above. All VMs on this host with firewall_enabled set
    would then allow connections on TCP port 22 from that remote VM.

    This rule would also match, since it has the remote VM's UUID as a target:

    {{#indent_and_wrap}}
    {{{rvm_rule2}}}
    {{/indent_and_wrap}}


## REMOTE VM PROPERTIES

    Remote VMs are simplified versions of the VM objects used by vmadm(1M).
    They are also in a JSON format, but only the properties below will be
    stored and used by fwadm. All other properties will be discarded. The
    properties used are:

    ips:

        Array of IP addresses for the remote VM. At least one IP from this
        property or the nics property below must be specified when creating
        or updating.

    nics:

        Array of nics, as per vmadm(1M). Only the "ip" property of each of
        these nic objects is required - all other properties will be ignored.
        This property is used for creation of remote VMs only - it is not
        stored in the object. IPs from these objects will be added to the ips
        array. This property is supported so the output of "vmadm get" on one
        host can be used in the input to "fwadm add" on another host.

    owner_uuid:

        Owner UUID. Only rules with a matching owner_uuid can use IPs for
        remote VMs with this property set.

    tags:

        vmadm(1M) tags object, mapping tag keys to values.

    uuid (required):

        UUID. This must not be the same as the UUID of any other remote VM or
        local VM managed by vmadm(1M).

    Note that VMs can be added and updated in this simplified representation,
    or using the same representation as "vmadm get". This enables the output
    of "vmadm get" or "vmadm lookup" to be input to the commands listed in the
    "SUBCOMMANDS" section.


## INTERACTION WITH VMADM(1M)

    fwadm relies on properties of VMs from vmadm(1M) in order to generate
    firewall rules correctly. Therefore, when vmadm is used to create a new
    VM or update properties on an existing VM that can affect firewall rules,
    it will update firewall rules through fwadm accordingly.

    As an example, if the following rules are present on a SmartOS host:

    {{#indent_and_wrap}}
    {{{vmadm_rule1}}}

    {{{vmadm_rule2}}}

    And then a VM is created with these parameters:

    {{{vmadm_vm1}}}

    The first rule would be applied to that VM.  If the following vmadm command
    was then run:

    {{{vmadm_cmd1}}}

    The second rule would then be applied to that VM in addition to the first.
    {{/indent_and_wrap}}


## EXIT STATUS

The following exit values are returned:

     0
         Successful completion.

     1
         An error occurred.

     2
         Invalid usage.
