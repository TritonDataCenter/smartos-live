.SH NAME
nischown \- change the owner of a NIS+ object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBnischown\fR [\fB-AfLP\fR] \fIowner\fR \fIname\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBnischown\fR changes the owner of the NIS+ objects or entries specified by \fIname\fR to \fIowner\fR. Entries are specified using indexed names (see \fBnismatch\fR(1)). If \fIowner\fR is not a fully qualified  NIS+ principal name (see \fBnisaddcred\fR(1M)), the default domain (see \fBnisdefaults\fR(1)) will be appended to it.
.sp
.LP
The only restriction on changing an object's owner is that you must have modify permissions for the object. Note: If you are the current owner of an object and you change ownership,  you may not be able to regain ownership unless you have modify access to  the new object.
.sp
.LP
The command will fail if the master \fBNIS+\fR server is not running.
.sp
.LP
The  \fBNIS+\fR server will check the validity of the name before making the modification.
.SH OPTIONS

The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-A\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n

.sp
.ne 2

.na
\fB\fB-P\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Follow the concatenation path within a named table. This option is only meaningful when either \fIname\fR is an indexed name or the \fB-L\fR option is also specified and the named object is a link pointing to entries.
