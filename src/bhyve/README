The uefi-csm-rom.bin file is a binary generated from the uefi-edk2 package
shipped in illumos-extra, where the source was from 2014 (the last time CSM
was available).

The uefi-rom.bin is a binary generated from the illumos downstream of
uefi-edk2, specifically the il-edk2-stable202308 branch.

Building the uefi ROM in illumos-extra is difficult thanks to its dependency
on various software that is not all currently in the 2021.4 pkgsrc zone that
SmartOS builds with.  While it is excluded from the build until SmartOS next
updates to a newer pkgsrc zone, it can be built from the illumos downstream in
a 2023.4 zone.
