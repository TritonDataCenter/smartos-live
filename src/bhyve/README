The uefi-csm-rom.bin file is a binary generated from the uefi-edk2 package
shipped in illumos-extra.  At the time of this writing, facilitating an
isolated build of the uefi ROM was difficult thanks to its dependency on iasl
to compile the ACPI tables it ships.  While it is excluded from the build until
those issues are solved, the ROM can be built from those sources (and patches)
provided a working iasl can be configured for the task.
