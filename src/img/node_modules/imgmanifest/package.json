For\ncontribution guidelines, issues, and general documentation, visit the main\n[SDC](http://github.com/joyent/sdc) project page.\n\nnode-imgmanifest is a node.js lib for working with SmartOS image manifests.\n\nThe SmartOS/SDC *Image* world involves a number of pieces:\n\n1. The `imgadm` tool in SmartOS for installing and managing images for VM\n   creation.\n2. The IMGAPI server in SmartDataCenter instances.\n3. The Joyent Images API, <https://images.joyent.com>.\n4. Possibly 3rd-party IMGAPI instances.\n5. `*-imgadm` tools for managing the above API servers.\n\nMost or all of these require being able to upgrade and validate image\nmanifests. This is the library for it.\n\n\n# Usage\n\n    var imgmanifest = require('imgmanifest');\n\n    // The latest Image manifest format version, i.e. the 'v' field\n    // in a manifest.\n    console.log(imgmanifest.V);\n\n    // Upgrade a manifest to the latest manifest format version.\n    var manifest = imgmanifest.upgradeManifest(manifest);\n\n    // Validate a manifest, according to the \"minimal\" requirements.\n    // \"Minimal\" requirements are those that, e.g., 'imgadm install'\n    // requires and that 'imgadm create' creates. It does require\n    // the manifest to include fields that are added by an IMGAPI\n    // repository. Returns null if the manifest is valid.\n    var errs = imgmanifest.validateMinimalManifest(manifest);\n\n\nNote: Current implementation of manifest validation here is **incomplete**.\n\n\n# Validation Errors\n\nThe `errs` returned by a `validate*Manifest` function is an array of\nobjects, e.g.:\n\n    [\n        {\n            \"field\": \"name\",\n            \"code\": \"MissingParameter\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"field\": \"os\",\n            \"code\": \"Invalid\",\n            \"message\": \"invalid os, \\\"my-os\\\", must be one of: smartos, linux, windows, other\"\n        }\n    ]\n\nEach error object will always include \"field\" and \"code\" keys and **may**\ninclude a \"message\" string field. Current error \"code\" values are:\n\n||MissingParameter||A required parameter was not provided.||\n||Invalid||The formatting of the field is invalid.||\n\n\nNote: This error format is based on\n<https://mo.joyent.com/docs/eng/master/#error-handling>.\n\n",
