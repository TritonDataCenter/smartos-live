* SYSTEM SPECIFICATION FILE
*

* moddir:
*
*	Set the search path for modules.  This has a format similar to the
*	csh path variable. If the module isn't found in the first directory
*	it tries the second and so on. The default is /kernel /usr/kernel
*
*	Example:
*		moddir: /kernel /usr/kernel /other/modules



* root device and root filesystem configuration:
*
*	The following may be used to override the defaults provided by
*	the boot program:
*
*	rootfs:		Set the filesystem type of the root.
*
*	rootdev:	Set the root device.  This should be a fully
*			expanded physical pathname.  The default is the
*			physical pathname of the device where the boot
*			program resides.  The physical pathname is
*			highly platform and configuration dependent.
*
*	Example:
*		rootfs:ufs
*		rootdev:/sbus@1,f8000000/esp@0,800000/sd@3,0:a
*
*	(Swap device configuration should be specified in /etc/vfstab.)



* exclude:
*
*	Modules appearing in the moddir path which are NOT to be loaded,
*	even if referenced. Note that `exclude' accepts either a module name,
*	or a filename which includes the directory.
*
*	Examples:
*		exclude: win
*		exclude: sys/shmsys



* forceload:
*
*	Cause these modules to be loaded at boot time, (just before mounting
*	the root filesystem) rather than at first reference. Note that
* 	forceload expects a filename which includes the directory. Also
*	note that loading a module does not necessarily imply that it will
*	be installed.
*
*	Example:
*		forceload: drv/foo



* set:
*
*	Set an integer variable in the kernel or a module to a new value.
*	This facility should be used with caution.  See system(4).
*
*	Examples:
*
*	To set variables in 'unix':
*
*		set nautopush=32
*		set maxusers=40
*
*	To set a variable named 'debug' in the module named 'test_module'
*
*		set test_module:debug = 0x13

*
* Want additional crash dump metrics
*

*
* With lots of zones, each with a large limit on lwps, we need more pids.  We
* could go to 999999, but for now stick with 5 digits to match the existing
* default of 30000.  This is mostly being conservative, so we can bump higher
* if necessary.
*
set pidmax=99999
