# === SUMMARY ===
#
# A really brute-force way to scan through the existing
# zvols and check to see if they're images.
#
# I'm relying pretty much on the chances of a image UUID
# being the same as the UUID of a machine
# (the odds of a collision are theoretically ~ 1 in 3x10^38)
#
# TODO: Set the zfs properties
