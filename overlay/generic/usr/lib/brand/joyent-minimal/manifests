#
# This file lists the SMF manifests which are available in the global
# zone and which should be setup for use in non-global zones.  Not
# all SMF services are usable within a zone, so only those that are usable
# should be listed here.
#
# The format of the file is:
#	manifest_name enable/disable
# The manifest_name is found relative to /lib/svc/manifest on the system.
# The second field is used to indicate if the svc should be enabled or
# disabled by default within zones, independently of its current status in
# the global zone.
#
# The following is a list of SMF svcs which could be run in a zone, but
# which we're not currently installing on our live image.  If we add any
# of these to the image and we want it to also be available in zones,
# then we need to move the entry to the end and uncomment it out.

# The following is a list of SMF svc manifests under /lib/svc/manifest.  These
# are available on our live image and are runnable in a zone.  Since the zones
# are sharing the base file system with the global zone, we set up so that
# only these svcs are configured in zones, independently of the global zone
# /lib/svc/manifest hierarchy.
